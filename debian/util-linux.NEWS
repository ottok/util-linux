util-linux (2.32-0.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The util-linux implementation of /bin/su is now used, replacing the
  one previously supplied by src:shadow (shipped in login package). The
  two implementations are very similar but have some minor differences
  (and there might be more that was not yet noticed ofcourse), e.g.
  - su '' (empty user string) used to give root, but now returns an error.
  - previously su only had one pam config, but now 'su -' is configured
    separately in /etc/pam.d/su-l

util-linux (2.29.2-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * The cfdisk, fdisk and sfdisk utilities has been split out into a
    separate fdisk package. Any package needing these utilities should
    add a dependency on: fdisk | util-linux (<< 2.29.2-3~)
    (The second part of it makes the dependency also be fulfilled in case
     of stretch-backports and should be considered optional.)

util-linux (2.25-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * The cytune command is no longer available since it has
    been removed upstream.

  * Upstream Release Notes also includes these highlights:

    The "swapon --summary" output format is deprecated in favor of the
    "swapon --show[=<columns>]" that provides better control on output
    formatting.

    cfdisk(8):
    - the code been completely rewritten, now it uses libfdisk and
      libsmartcols, supports GPT, SUN, SGI and BSD disk labels
    - the command is no more based on CHS addressing

  * WARNING! The fsck command is no longer built on non-linux.
    It relies on libmount, which needs porting.

util-linux (2.24.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  This is a major update which is long overdue.
  This release attempts to unify the work that has happened upstream
  with the work that has gone on in parallell in the Debian package.

  A few things are no longer shipped since they have been removed upstream:
  ddate - convert Gregorian dates to Discordian dates
  chkdupexe - report dangling symlinks and duplicately-named binaries
